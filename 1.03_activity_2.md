# 1.03 Activity 2

(_Keep using the same notebook you used in the activity 1._)

1. Merge the 'data' dataframe you created in class with the dataframes for 'file3' and 'file4' you created in the last activity. If you are not able to merge the dataframes, please take a look at the order of columns and/or the shape of the dataframes (specifically the number of columns in the dataframes). Also check the shape of the new dataframe
2. Drop the columns `domain` and `dob`
3. Rearrange the columns by placing columns `ic2`, `ic3`, `ic4`, `ic5` before the column `median_home_val`
4. Filter the rows where gender is `M` and state is `FL`. Do not store the results in data.
5. Filter the rows where the target value is less than 100 and gender is `F`. Do not store the results in data.
